# node-quneo

This is a work in progress module for providing some tools to work with a QuNeo controller in node.js land (probably via node-osc, unless you're a masochist).

If you have any ammendments or can improve this, feel free to fork the project, do your magic and then send me a pull request ;-)

## Installing

````bash
npm install quneo
````

## Usage

Include the quneo module and you can then do stuff with its hopefully self-explanative methods.

````javascript
var quneo = require('quneo');

quneo.getPadLedsPath(1, 'green'); // returns /quneo/leds/pads/0/SW/green/

````
